# Retail-Project-Recommendations
<br>
<br>
<br>
1. UX & Website Optimization
<br>
- Don't touch the Checkout flow: The conversion rates from Checkout Start $/to$ Purchase are excellent(80%+).
<br>
- Action Point: DO not redesign the checkout page right now; you might risk breaking something that is working perfectly.
<br>
<br>
2. Marketing Strategy
<br>
- Stop Over-Investing in Social for Sales: Socia Media is driving 30% of our traffic but has the lowest conversion rate(Efficiency). We are likely paying for "window shoppers".
<br>
- Action Point: Shift budget away from "Traffic" objectives on social ads and focus on "Retargeting" or "Lead Gen" to capture emails instead.
<br>
<br>
- Double Down on Email Marketing: Email is our highest converting channel(13%+ conbversion rate vs 6% for Social).
<br>
Action Point: Implement an aggressive email capture pop-up for those high-volume Social visitors. If we can get them onto our email list, our data proves they are far more likely to buy later.
<br>
<br>
3. Financial & Revenue:
<br>
- Audit Ad Spent Against AOV: We found our Average Order Value is $115.
<br>
Set a stricter Customer Acquisition Cost(CAC) limit. If we are paying more than $30-$40 to acquire a customer via Social Media Ads, we are likely losing money on those specific transactions.
